# MuCr (Music Collector)

We want a Web application to manage the musical collections of a user or group of people (eg a club), which may include vinyl records (plus the corresponding properties: new/old, 33⅓ vs 45, colored or not, weighing 120/180/200 g, stereo/mono, special editions, usage, etc.), magnetic tape recorder (eg duration, wear, stereo/mono, ...) or tape recorder, show programs/tickets/musical concerts. Multi-criteria classification and filtering based on music style, artists, geographic location, user preferences, rarity of items in a collection, and more will be achieved. Additional interest information will be taken from public music services such as MusicBrainz. Managing musical collections will also be done through an API adopting the REST paradigm.  
Bonus: adopting attractive data viewing tools.
